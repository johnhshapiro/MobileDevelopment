# MobileDevelopment
*Projects completed in CS 3013 Mobile Computing during the Spring 2020 semester at MSU Denver. Projects are in order by assignment number.*

## 1. MagicMissiles
This assignment was designed for us to make use of fragments. There is a fragment on the top half, and a fragment on the bottom half. The application rolls a number of four sided diced chosen by the user.

## 2. ColorPicker
This project allows the user to choose a color and save it by name. Persistence is achieved by using the applications local data.

## 3. Animation
Our professor (Dr. Aaron Gordon) provided us with an animation application, and we were required to add our own animations using the tools provided.

## 4. Intents
This assignment required us to have the Animation application call the ColorPicker application (both listed above) using intents and change the color of an element in the former.

## 5. FlashBeepShake
This application allows the user to turn on the flash, generate a tone, and make the phone vibrate.

## 6. TalkerM
This application uses base bluetooth code provided by our professor (Dr. Aaron Gordon), which was modified in such a way that two Android devices could connect via bluetooth. Once connected, one device could tell the other device to perform the actions present in FlashBeepShake (listed above).

## 7. RockPaperScissors (final project)
This application allows the user to play rock-paper-scissors using motion controls. The user picks a username, and the users high score (the number of wins in a row) is stored via Firebase through a Cloud Firestore instance. The user can also view the top ten scores of all time, which is generated using the Cloud Firestore Instance.
